library(ggplot2)

# plotting with NULL families --- must install default fonts locally
ggplot(mtcars, aes(mpg, wt)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_rieke(title_family = NULL,
              base_family = NULL) +

       subtitle = "You can also use any markdown formatting, including *italics*",
       caption = "Note the use of break<br>for line breaks")
