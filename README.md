This is a collection of functions I use regularly both in professional &
personal projects. Formalizing in a development package helps speed up
workflows without having to re-define functions in each project. If it
makes sense, I may coalesce common functions into their own dedicated
package, but this can be considered an ever-in-progress testing ground.

Others should note that this is intended primarily for use by me, and it
may not be the most well-documented or error-resilient.

## Installation

If youâ€™d like to use, this package can be installed with the
[devtools](https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/pandoc/devtools.html)
package:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("https://github.com/markjrieke/riekelib")
```
